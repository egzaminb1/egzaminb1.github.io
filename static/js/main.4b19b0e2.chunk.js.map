Zawarte tu teksty to krótkie komunikaty, fragmenty rozmów, nagrania programów radiowych i telewizyjnych oraz teksty preparowane na użytek egzaminu. Do każdego nagrania należy wykonać zadanie. Uwaga! Zwykle nagrania odtwarzane są dwa razy, ale jedno — tylko jeden raz. Teksty do wysłuchania prezentowane są z płyty CD lub kasety i niemożliwe jest zatrzymanie lub ponowne odtworzenie płyty (kasety). W związku z tym w tej części egzaminu zadania muszą być wykonane we wskazanej kolejności, a aktywność egzaminatora ogranicza się do rozdania testów oraz do włączenia nagrania. Dlatego wszystkie pytania i ewentualne wątpliwości należy rozstrzygać tuż po otrzymaniu testu — w czasie słuchania nie jest to możliwe. Przed każdym nagraniem pojawia się moment ciszy. Należy go wykorzystać na przeczytanie zadania, żeby wiedzieć, które z usłyszanych informacji będą ważne. Natomiast podczas chwili przerwy przed drugim odtworzeniem tego samego tekstu należy zrobić korektę zapisanych już słów (zdań) i zastanowić się nad brakującymi informacjami.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n

Należy wybrać jeden zestaw spośród trzech i wykonać obydwa polecenia (punkt a i b). Pierwsze zadanie to zredagowanie krótkiego tekstu o określonej formie (np. życzenia, pozdrowienia, ogłoszenie). Warto przypomnieć sobie, jaką strukturą charakteryzuje się konkretna forma, np. zaproszenie to nagłówki, zwroty do adresata, daty czy dane adresowe. W drugim zadaniu należy napisać dłuższy tekst,np.list oficjalny lub nieoficjalny, opis, tekst argumentacyjny lub opowiadanie, podstawową formą życiorysu lub podania.</p>\r\n            <h5>Uwaga! Długość napisanego tekstu powinna być zgodna z liczbą słów podanych w poleceniu.

Powinien on zawierać wypunktowane informacje i argumenty. Aby nie tracić czasu na liczenie wyrazów podczas egzaminu, można wcześniej w domu wykonać „próbę ilościową”: zapisać odręcznie na arkuszu A4 około sześciu linijek, potem policzyć, ile słów zawiera ten tekst, a następnie wyliczoną liczbę słów podzielić przez liczbę linijek. Uzyskany w ten sposób wynik będzie średnią słów, które zwykle mieszczą się w jednej linijce. Można wtedy na egzaminie liczyć linijki, a nie słowa.</p>\r\n            <p>Niektóre osoby pierwszą wersję tekstu zapisują w brudnopisie. Egzaminatorzy oceniają jednak wyłącznie czystopis. Zatem należy tak rozplanować czas, aby wystarczyło go jeszcze na przepisanie tekstu na arkusze do tego przeznaczone.</p>\r\n            <p>Wypowiedź pisemna oceniana jest niezależnie przez dwie osoby. Wynik testu to suma punktów obu egzaminatorów.

Na drugim planie jedzie na rowerze mężczyzna w średnim wieku. To chyba jej tata. Ma na sobie szare szorty i czarną koszulkę. Jest uśmiechnięty i cały czas obserwuje, co robi córka. Obok mężczyzny, po lewej stronie, jedzie jeszcze jedna dziewczynka. Może to starsza córka? Jest szczupła i ma długie, jasne włosy. Ona dobrze jeździ na rowerze. Myślę, że ta rodzina lubi uprawiać sport. Dziś już długo jeździli i teraz są trochę zmęczeni, ale zadowoleni, ponieważ młodsza córka coraz lepiej jeździ na rolkach. Sądzę, że tata mobilizuje córki do tego, by aktywnie spędzały wolny czas. W ten sposób dbają o kondycję oraz zdrowie.</p>\r\n        <p>Wydaje mi się, że jest lato i są wakacje, ponieważ pogoda jest słoneczna, jest ciepło, a drzewa i trawa w tle są zielone. Sądzę, że ta rodzina ciekawie zaplanowała urlop. Fotografia bardzo mi się podoba, bo przypomina moje wakacje i czas, który spędzam z rodziną.

Jakie formy wypoczynku uważa Pan/Paniza najlepsze? (monolog) </h5>\r\n        <p>Kiedy mam wolny czas, najchętniej spotykam się z przyjaciółmi i znajomymi. Zwykle idziemy razem do kawiarni albo do kina. Wspólnie decydujemy, co mamy ochotę robić. Dużo się śmiejemyi robimy wszystko, żeby się dobrze bawić.</p>\r\n        <p>Lubię też w wolnym czasie czytać książki.

Myślę, że szczególnie jest potrzebny tym, którzy cały dzień w pracy spędzają przed komputerem.</p>\r\n        <p>Z jednej strony ważne jest, aby dbać o swoje zdrowie, ale z drugiej strony przecież nie każdy lubi chodzić na basen czy uprawiać jakiś sport. Są osoby, które wolą po całym dniu pracy usiąść przed telewizorem, obejrzeć jakiś film, ewentualnie pójść na krótki spacer do, parku. Z kolei młodzi ludzie chętnie w wolnym czasie korzystają z komputera — Internetu, gier komputerowych. Nie jest dobrze, jeśli przed komputerem spędza się za dużo czasu, więc rodzice powinni zadbać, aby komputer nie był włączony cały wieczór i noc.</p>\r\n        <p>Moim zdaniem najlepiej w wolnym czasie robić to, co się lubi. Sądzę, że najważniejsze jest, aby zrelaksować się i odpocząć.

Tematyka związana jest z typowymi sytuacjami (oficjalnymii nieoficjalnymi) z życia codziennego, np. rozmowa telefoniczna. Kiedy to konieczne, należy pamiętać o zachowaniu form grzecznościowych(np. pan/pani). Zdający najczęściej wchodzi w rolę: przyjaciela, znajomego, członka rodziny, turysty, obcego, ucznia, nauczyciela, studenta, profesora, pracownika, pracodawcy, pacjenta czy klienta.</p>\r\n        <p>Czas przed rozpoczęciem wypowiedzi warto przeznaczyć na szybkie zastanowienie się, o co należy zapytać oraz jaką rolę trzeba odegrać — wszystkie te informacje zdający odnajdzie w poleceniu. Ważne jest więc, aby uważnie przeczytać polecenie i zaplanować, jak pokierować rozmową, jakich użyć argumentów. Nie warto pisać całego dialogu, ponieważ nie jesteśmy w stanie przewidzieć reakcji naszego rozmówcy.

W trakcie wypowiedzi członkowie komisji egzaminacyjnej mogą zadawać pytania.</p>\r\n            <h4>Zasady oceniania zadań</h4>\r\n            <h5>Kryteria oceny:</h5>\r\n            <div className='pointE'>\r\n            <table>\r\n                <thead>\r\n                    <tr><td>Wykonanie zadań (20 p.)</td></tr>\r\n                </thead>\r\n                <tbody>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Zadanie 1 (opis fotografii)</td>\r\n                        <td>0 – 7 p.</td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Zadanie 2 (monolog)</td>\r\n                        <td>0 – 7 p.</td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Zadanie 3 (sytuacja komunikacyjna)</td>\r\n                        <td>0 – 6 p.</td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                </tbody>\r\n            </table>\r\n            <table>\r\n                <thead>\r\n                    <tr><td>Poprawność językowa (20 p.)</td></tr>\r\n                </thead>\r\n                <tbody>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Gramatyka</td>\r\n                        <td>0 – 8 p.</td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Słownictwo i styl</td>\r\n                        <td>0 – 8 p.</td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td>Poprawność fonetyczna i płynność wypowiedzi</td>\r\n                        <td>0 – 4 p.</td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                </tbody>\r\n            </table>\r\n            <p>RAZEM: maksymalnie 40 p.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n            <hr></hr>\r\n            {   (props.selectExe===0)?<WzorE></WzorE>:\r\n                <div className='exerciseE'>\r\n                <h5>Zadanie {props.selectExe}.1.</h5>\r\n                <p>{props.zad1}</p>\r\n                <img alt='' src={props.img}></img>\r\n                <h5>Zadanie {props.selectExe}.2.</h5>\r\n                <p>{props.zad2}</p>\r\n                <h5>Zadanie {props.selectExe}.3.</h5>\r\n                <p>{props.zad3}</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            }\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n)}\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps=(state)=>{\r\nreturn(\r\n    {\r\n    selectExe:state.QuizCatE.selectExe,\r\n    headerLeft:state.QuizCatE.catE.catHeader[0],\r\n    headerRight:state.QuizCatE.catE.catHeader[1],\r\n    zad1:state.QuizCatE.currentQuiz.exercise[0],\r\n    zad2:state.QuizCatE.currentQuiz.exercise[1],\r\n    zad3:state.QuizCatE.currentQuiz.exercise[2],\r\n    img:state.QuizCatE.currentQuiz.img\r\n    }\r\n)}\r\nconst mapDispatchToProps=(dispatch)=>(\r\n    {\r\n       \r\n    }\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(CatE)","import { useState } from \"react\"\r\nimport { Modal, ModalBody, ModalHeader } from \"reactstrap\"\r\n\r\nexport const DescCatB=()=>{\r\n    const[open, setOpen]=useState(true)\r\n    return(\r\n        <Modal isOpen={open} toggle={() => setOpen(false)}>\r\n            <ModalHeader>\r\n                Część B \r\n                <button  type=\"button\" className=\"btn-close\" onClick={() => setOpen(false)}  ></button>\r\n            </ModalHeader>\r\n            <ModalBody>\r\n            <div>\r\n            <h5>Maksymalna liczba punktów — 40</h5>\r\n            <h5>Czas przeznaczony na wykonanie zadań - 60 min</h5>\r\n            <h5>Warunkiem zdania egzaminu jest uzyskanie pozytywnego wyniku (minimum 60%, czyli 24p.) z każdej części egzaminu</h5>\r\n            <h4>Ogólny opis umiętności</h4>\r\n            <p>Zdający powinni umieć rozpoznawać i stosować poprawne gramatycznie formy językowe, pozwalające na wyrażanie intencji mówiącego w zakresie sprecyzowanym w standardach wymagań egzaminacyjnych.

Film powstał na podstawie bestsellerowej powieści Katarzyny Grocholi pod tym samym tytułem (podobnie było z Dziennikiem Bridget Jones). Nieustanne porównywania z postacią stworzoną przez Helen Fielding były nieuniknione. Gazety główną bohaterkę, Judytę, nazwały polską Bridget Jones. Bohaterka Grocholi rozwiodła się, zakochała się w innym mężczyźnie wybudowała dla siebie i swojej córki dom. Judyta jest kobietą, która w trudnych życiowych chwilach nie załamuje się, ale bierze sprawy w swoje ręce i nie waha się zacząć wszystkiego od nowa.`,\r\n        `Wielką zaletą Nigdy w życiu jest doskonały humor.
